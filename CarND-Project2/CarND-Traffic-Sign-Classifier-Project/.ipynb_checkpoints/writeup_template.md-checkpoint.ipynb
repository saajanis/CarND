    "\n",
    "I used the numpy library conbined with python's native methods to calculate summary statistics of the traffic signs data set. Here are the summaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Number of training examples = 34799\n",

    "#### 1. Data set(s) preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transformations:\n",
    "I decided to apply a few transformations to the data and test out my model's performance on each one of them. For each transformation, I'm including a few images after that transformation was applied to show what they look like (this is for general intuition -- I don't think it matters for how the neural net operates).\n",
    "*Similar transformations were applied to images in each dataset*\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Normalization:**\n",
    "* I took each dataset, computed the mean pixel value for all the images in the dataset and used it to normalize every pixel in every image in the dataset using the formula new_pixel_value = ((old_pixel_value - mean_pixel_value)/mean_pixel_value). This is with an expectation to make it easier for the model to work with the images since the mean of the pixels in the dataset is closer to zero now. Here's what the training dataset looks like now:\n",

    "**2. Cropping the original images:**\n",
    "* The provided dataset(s) have a 'coords' property which gives information about a bounding box around the traffic sign within the image. I cropped out the part specified by the bounding box in each of train, test and validation dataset and resized the image to 32*32 by padding it with black pixels. This should assist the neural network with translational variance in the images. For my testing dataset of 5 images, I purposefully did something similar by only taking a tightly bounded picture from the internet. Here's what the training dataset looks like now:\n",

    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "**4. Grayscaling the cropped images:**\n",
    "* Grayscaling will reduce the number of channels from 3 to 1 for each \"pixel\". This may work out if the model is too sensitive to slight variations in conditions under which images were shot etc.. \n",

    "All the results are very comparable and satisfactory and too statistically insignificant to declare a winner here. LeNet architecture proved to be the right choice for this problem, mainly because of the similarity of this problem to the hand-written digit recognition problem where eNet has already proven to work well. Our problem has similar characteristics where translational invariance, finding hidden features etc. will help the network classify better. I also believe that the order of the number of classes between handwritten digit recognition problem and our problem is comparable, which helps teh architecture work in our favour but I have no evidece to prove that LeNet won't perform well when the number of classes is huge.\n",
